# PetDelegate

PetDelegate is an engaging mobile application for iOS that allows users to learn about HTTP status codes using funny images of cats and dogs.

### Main Features
- Main Screen: The main screen displays a large black-and-white image of an unknown character and two buttons: "CAT" and "DOG".
- Status Selection: Clicking on the "CAT" or "DOG" button opens a new screen with a table of HTTP status codes, each represented by a funny image of cats or dogs, respectively.
- Status Presentation: The status screen opens in a presenter format, which can be expanded or collapsed by pulling the top of the screen.
- Image Change: Clicking on any image in the status collection changes the image on the main screen to the selected one.
- Data Loading: On the first launch of the application, a red activity indicator is displayed while data is being loaded from the server.
